-- Data exploration using 5 related tables:

	-- fortune500: information on top US companies
	-- stackoverflow: questions asked on Stack Overflow with certain tags
	-- company: information on companies related to tags in stackoverflow
	-- tag_company: links stackoverflow to company
	-- tag_type: type categories applied to tags in stackoverflow

-- Skills demonstrated: simple functions, aggregate functions, data filtering, joins, common table expressions (CTEs),
-- aliases, coalescing data, correlations, series generation, temporary tables, subqueries, truncation
